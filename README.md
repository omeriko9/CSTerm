CSTerm - Simple Windows COM Terminal

But.. there are many terminal applications out there, why another one?

The reason is that I used Termite for many many years, until this week where it started to crash on long fast (115200) logs.
So I created this small simple terminal which doesn't crash.

That's all.

Not many options for now - only COM and Baud can be set up but I will (maybe lol) add later more options
